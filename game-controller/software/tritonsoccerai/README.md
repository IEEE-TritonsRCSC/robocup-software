## Run all Build Steps at Once

In order to complete all required build steps outlined below, run the following:

```

```

## Install dependency

Dependencies are managed by Maven. Maven manages dependencies according to the **pom.xml** file under root.

run the following to install maven plug-ins and dependencies

```shell
mvn clean install
```

The install will invoke protoc to generate the needed proto-java files under

```shell
./target/generated-sources/protobuf/java/*.java
```



## VS Code

If you are using VS Code, make sure to run "mvn clean install" every time you open this repository with VS Code. This is due to an issue with VS Code deleting generated-resources files on start up: https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-java/issues/177

```shell
mvn compile
```



To run JUnit Tests,

```shell
mvn test
```



Run the following command to compile, run JUnit test, and generate the **jar package**

```shell

```

The jar is generated under **target/[ProjectName]-[Version]-SNAPSHOT.jar**



## Execute

Execute using maven:
