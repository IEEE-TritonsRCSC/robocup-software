# Workflow

## Overview

TritonsRCSC Software uses Scrum, an Agile framework, to manage our workflow and ensure steady progress towards our objectives.

Each team works in sprints (1 or 2 weeks long) and engages in sprint planning and review/retrospective at the beginning/end of every sprint. At these meetings, a sprint backlog MUST be produced and added to the repository for documentation and reference.

Product backlogs MUST be created by the Software Lead every year and must be periodically updated throughout the course of the year.
